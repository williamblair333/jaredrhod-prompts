# The Voice Line: Windows Edition

Paste this whole prompt into Claude Code on Windows. Your agent builds a voice conversation system: hold a key, talk to your agent out loud, release, and it answers through your speakers in a real voice. Type instead whenever you want, same conversation. Everything runs local, $0 on a Claude subscription. This is the same proven build as the original Voice Line, written native for Windows and hardened with the real fixes from a full Windows build contributed by joatsaint (jaredrhod Discord). It now also carries the exact speed and stability fixes out of my own build, the one you see answering in about a second on my lives.

---

I want you to build me a voice conversation system for talking to you out loud at my desk, on Windows. Build it exactly to this spec. It is a proven design, hardened by a real build on Windows, so where this spec is specific, follow it precisely. The gotchas throughout are hard-won lessons. Read the whole spec before writing any code.

## What it does

I hold a key anywhere in Windows, my mic opens, I talk. I release the key, and what I said gets transcribed locally, sent to a live Claude Code session (you, with all your tools and my project context), and your reply is spoken through my speakers in a natural voice, sentence by sentence as you generate it. First audio should land about 1 to 2 seconds after I release the key on warm turns.

## Architecture (half-duplex)

```
mic -> ears (sounddevice capture)
    -> local whisper server on port 2022
    -> warm Claude Agent SDK session (streaming, one client per session)
    -> mouth (sentence-chunked TTS via local Kokoro on port 8880, cancellable playback)
    -> speakers
```

Half-duplex means the mic is gated while the mouth is speaking so the system never hears itself. Do not attempt barge-in on open speakers.

## The single most likely first crash, avoid it from the start

Windows' default asyncio event loop is the ProactorEventLoop, and the Claude Agent SDK needs it for subprocess handling. That loop does NOT implement `asyncio.add_reader()`, so any input-reading code built on it raises `NotImplementedError` on startup. Never read stdin or keystrokes through `add_reader`. Read input on a background thread and feed it into the asyncio loop with `call_soon_threadsafe`. This shapes the whole input design below.

## Project layout

Create the project at the `voice-line` folder in my user directory with a uv-managed Python 3.12 environment:

- `main.py` entry point, the turn loop, hold-to-talk wiring
- `ears.py` mic capture and transcription
- `brain.py` the warm Claude Agent SDK session
- `mouth.py` TTS queue and playback
- `ptt.py` the global hold-to-talk key listener
- `ducking.py` optional Spotify ducking
- `signals.py` the visualizer signal bus (spec below)
- `vlog.py` a plain session log: what I said, what it said, interrupts, TTS fallbacks. When something misbehaves we read the log instead of guessing.
- `run-voice-line.bat` launcher. It kills any already-running copy of the voice line before starting (find the old python process running voice_line and taskkill exactly that one): two live voice processes both hear the mic and both answer, and it sounds haunted.

Python packages: sounddevice, webrtcvad, numpy, pynput, claude-agent-sdk, httpx, and pycaw for the ducking. Pin setuptools below 81 because webrtcvad needs pkg_resources. You also need the ffmpeg binary available.

## Services this rides on

Two local servers must exist. Check for them and set them up if missing:

1. A whisper.cpp server on port 2022 with a small English model, using CUDA if I have an Nvidia GPU, plain CPU otherwise. GOTCHA: different whisper server builds expose different routes. Some only expose `/inference`, not the OpenAI-style `/v1/audio/transcriptions` that client libraries assume. Test the real endpoint with curl BEFORE wiring code to it, and build the client against the route that actually answers.
2. A Kokoro TTS server on port 8880 exposing `/v1/audio/speech` (kokoro-fastapi works well). Request `response_format: pcm`, which returns raw int16 at 24kHz mono. Pick a voice you like, `bm_lewis` is a good default. GOTCHA, and it is silent: kokoro-fastapi's own GPU launch script can install a CPU-only torch build, because `uv pip install -e ".[gpu]"` runs in uv's pip-compatible legacy mode which ignores the project's custom PyTorch CUDA index routing. Even `uv sync --extra gpu` can resolve wrong. If that happens, install the exact pinned CUDA wheel directly from the PyTorch CUDA index. ALWAYS verify with `torch.cuda.is_available()` before trusting GPU is active: the app still runs on CPU, just 10 to 14 times slower, and nothing tells you.

## Hold-to-talk (the default mode)

- Global key listener via pynput. It works out of the box on a normal Windows console process, no special OS permission gate. Just make sure microphone access is allowed for desktop apps under Windows Settings, Privacy and security, Microphone.
- Holding the chosen key opens the mic, releasing closes it with a 0.18 second tail so my last word survives.
- Taps shorter than 250ms are ignored.
- CRITICAL: the OS fires key-repeat on_press events continuously while a key is held. Filter with a held-state flag or every repeat becomes a fresh press. This bug will kill every reply before it speaks if you skip it.
- Pressing the key while the assistant is talking interrupts playback immediately. This makes it speaker-safe with no headphones.
- The mic is fully closed between holds so room audio and music never leak into the transcriber.
- Never run the voice line itself as a background service. Nobody wants a 24/7 open mic. (The two SERVERS can be services, see the bottom.)

Also build a legacy open-mic mode behind an `--open-mic` flag: webrtcvad endpointing, discard any utterance with less than 240ms of actual speech, and strip bracketed non-speech markers like [SIGHS] and [BLANK_AUDIO] that whisper emits. Know the tradeoff before choosing it: with an always-open mic, audio playing in the room (a video, music, even Claude Code's own built-in voice mode) can get picked up as speech and trigger replies to dialogue never meant for the assistant. That false-trigger risk is the real argument for hold-to-talk as the default.

## The brain

- One warm ClaudeSDKClient per voice session, created at launch. Warm turns are fast; the first turn pays a prompt-cache toll of several seconds, so hide it behind a spoken greeting by firing a warmup query at startup.
- Pin the brain's model to the fast tier and pass the FULL model id, today that is `claude-sonnet-5`. Do not let the session inherit my terminal default: the big deep-work models make you wait noticeably longer for the first word of every reply, and they burn through a subscription's usage doing it. This one setting is most of the speed difference people ask me about. GOTCHA: never pass a bare alias like "sonnet". The SDK resolves aliases through its own bundled CLI and can silently land on an older model, so pass the full id and verify the resolved model in the SDK's init message. Add a launch flag that swaps in a bigger model for the rare session where I want deep thinking over speed.
- Set the session cwd to the project folder whose CLAUDE.md defines your identity, so the voice session is the same assistant as my terminal sessions.
- Use the system prompt preset with an appended spoken-discipline block: short conversational sentences, no markdown, no code blocks, no lists read aloud, write for the ear. TTS performs punctuation, so dull text is dull audio. After the first sentence, ship sentences in two-sentence breaths, since lone short sentences sound flat.
- Stream partial messages. Chunk into sentences and hand each completed sentence to the mouth immediately.
- CRITICAL: flush the sentence buffer when a content block stops. If you only flush on sentence-ending punctuation, pre-tool filler like "On it, checking now" sits silent through the whole tool run and then plays glued to the answer.
- CRITICAL, this is the bug behind every voice build that "stops responding after a few turns": the SDK client has ONE shared message stream, and receive_response() stops at the first ResultMessage it sees, with no pairing between a question and its answer. When an interrupt cancels your reader mid-turn, the dead turn's leftover messages, including its ResultMessage, stay buffered in the pipe. The next question pairs with that stale leftover and yields nothing, and every question after that gets the answer to the PREVIOUS question, for the rest of the session. The fix: after any interrupted turn and before the next query, call the client's interrupt(), then drain the message stream through the stale ResultMessage with a timeout, and if the drain cannot realign, rebuild the session rather than run desynced.
- Quit phrases end the session: "goodbye", "end voice mode", "hang up". Ctrl-C also works.

## The mouth

- A queue of sentences, cancellable mid-stream (interrupt = clear queue + stop playback now).
- CRITICAL pipeline shape, proven on Windows: run synthesis and playback as a two-stage pipeline with two queues, so synthesis of the NEXT sentence overlaps playback of the current one. A naive one-queue loop that synthesizes then plays each sentence fully sequentially produces a real, audible dead-air gap at every sentence boundary.
- Open ONE long-lived output stream and reuse it for every sentence for the life of the process. A fresh stream per sentence gives you a blip or a beat of dead air at every sentence boundary on plenty of audio setups (USB interfaces, Bluetooth, streaming mixers and per-app capture software that latch onto each new stream late). On interrupt, stop feeding the stream and pad about 150ms of silence, do not close and reopen it.
- Buffer about 0.75 seconds of synthesized audio before a sentence starts playing, so a slower machine never underruns into slow-motion garble.
- **The voice is my choice. Before you build the mouth, ask me:** free local voice (Kokoro, the default, $0 forever), or a higher quality ElevenLabs voice using my own ElevenLabs API key. If I pick ElevenLabs, walk me through creating the key, point me at their voice library so I can pick ANY voice I like (the voice id is one setting in the code), store the key in an ELEVENLABS_API_KEY env var (never hardcode it), and keep Kokoro wired in as the automatic fallback so if ElevenLabs is down or the key runs out of credits the voice degrades instead of going mute.
- Kokoro path: POST the sentence, get raw PCM int16 24kHz mono, play through sounddevice.
- ElevenLabs path, hard-won audio doctrine: fetch mp3_44100_128 and decode locally with ffmpeg (raw PCM at 44.1k needs their Pro tier, and the mp3 decode hides inside network wait). Use the turbo model with stability 0.5 and similarity 0.75. Do not use the multilingual model for English and do not set style above 0, both make delivery slow and dull. Their website voice previews are mastered demo clips, raw API output never matches them, so master locally with an ffmpeg chain: presence boost around 3.2kHz, a little low shelf around 140Hz, gentle compression, a limiter.
- While audio is playing, feed the signal bus (below) with each PCM block.

## Typed input (first-class, not a side channel)

Typing in the voice terminal is a real turn: typed lines go into the exact same handler as speech, so the reply is spoken aloud, typing while it talks interrupts playback, and the quit phrases work typed. The Windows way to build it:

- Windows consoles have no termios and no cbreak raw mode. Read character-level input with `msvcrt` on a background thread, and feed completed lines into the asyncio loop via `call_soon_threadsafe` (never `add_reader`, see the crash warning at the top).
- Race the typed queue against the key listener with `asyncio.wait` FIRST_COMPLETED and keep unfinished futures alive across iterations.
- Run your own tiny line editor on top of the raw characters, with paste-aware input: enable `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` so Windows Terminal's bracketed-paste sequences are detectable, assemble a paste invisibly into ONE message no matter its shape, scrub gutter glyphs and hard wraps out of pasted text, and echo a long paste as a character count instead of the text.

## Spotify ducking (optional but great)

While the assistant speaks, if Spotify is playing above volume 30, drop it to max(30, current x 0.6). On Windows the clean hook is `pycaw`, the Core Audio session API: it controls a specific app's own volume slider directly, which is exactly what we want. Restore with a 1.2 second debounce so back-to-back sentence chunks do not yo-yo the volume. Never launch Spotify if it is not running.

## The signal bus (for the visualizer)

Write these files in the project root so a separate visualizer can watch them. My visualizer prompt builds a browser scene that reads this bus through its own small read-only server, but the contract is just files, so anything can watch them. Your only job is to write them, all writes wrapped in try/except, the bus must never crash the voice line. (One file you never write: `.voice_alert`. That one belongs to any OTHER process on the machine that wants the visualizer's attention.)

- `.voice_state` plain text, one of: idle, listening, thinking, speaking
- `.voice_waveform` JSON `{"ts": <unix float>, "samples": [64 floats]}`, written at most 15 times per second while audio plays. Downsample each PCM block to 64 points, raw int16 magnitudes are fine.
- `.voice_loading_pid` exists while an optional thinking sound is playing

State transitions: key press writes listening, key release writes thinking, first audio block writes speaking, playback end writes idle. CRITICAL self-heal rule: every waveform write also re-writes state to speaking. This only runs while audio is audibly playing, and it means any stray process that stomps the state file gets corrected within about 70ms. This one rule fixed a bug that took a whole evening to find.

## Optional: run the two servers as real Windows services (survive reboots)

If I want the whisper and Kokoro servers to auto-start on boot and auto-restart on crash, install them as Windows services with NSSM from an elevated PowerShell window (service installs always need Administrator, no way around it). Two real gotchas from doing this:

- The `LocalSystem` service account does not inherit my user PATH, so if the speech server uses an ffmpeg-dependent conversion flag, either add ffmpeg to the system PATH explicitly or drop the flag when the audio is already in the right format.
- Re-running an install command against a service that already exists can silently no-op on updating its arguments: some service tools only apply command-line changes at creation. Force-set the application path and arguments every time the install script runs, not just on first creation.

The voice line itself stays a foreground app I launch when I want it. Only the servers become services.

## Verify before you call it done

1. Both local servers respond on their real routes, and if CUDA is expected, `torch.cuda.is_available()` says True.
2. A full turn end to end: hold, speak, release, hear the reply.
3. Interrupt works mid-reply.
4. Interrupt a reply, then ask something new, and confirm the answer matches the NEW question. Repeat it a few times: this is the stream drain proving itself, and skipping this check is how builds ship with the off-by-one bug.
5. A tool-using turn speaks filler within a couple of seconds, then the answer.
6. No audible dead-air gaps between spoken sentences (the two-stage pipeline is doing its job).
7. Launch a second copy and confirm the first one dies. One body, one mouth.
8. Nothing plays twice and the mic never hears the speakers.

Then show me the launch command and a one-page cheat sheet of the controls.
